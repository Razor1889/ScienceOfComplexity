# ScienceOfComplexity
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and code exercises based on Think Complexity by Allen B. Downey. The book dives into the field of complexity science through Python programming, offering hands-on experience with models of complex systems.

## About the Book
Think Complexity introduces readers to complex systems, which are systems composed of many interacting components. It emphasizes discrete models of physical and social phenomena and explores topics across:

Networks and graphs

Cellular automata

Agent-based modeling and swarms

Fractals and self-organization

Chaotic and cybernetic systems

Concepts from the philosophy of science

This work is a continuation of Think Python, and assumes a foundational understanding of Python programming.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
Each chapter is paired with a corresponding notebook that includes:

Python implementations of models and simulations

Visualizations of behavior and patterns in complex systems

Commentary and questions that reflect on the philosophical implications of scientific modeling

Exercises with solutions
